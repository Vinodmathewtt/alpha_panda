# Event System

A refactored, lightweight event system built on NATS JetStream with clear separation of concerns, schema-driven deserialization, and declarative event handlers.

## Architecture

The event system follows the blueprint from the refactor plan with four core components:

### 1. EventBusCore - "Thin" Connection Manager
```python
from core.events import get_event_bus_core

event_bus = get_event_bus_core(settings)
await event_bus.connect()    # Connect to NATS
await event_bus.disconnect() # Graceful shutdown
```

**Responsibilities**: NATS connection lifecycle only. No publishing or subscribing.

### 2. SchemaRegistry & EventFactory - Type-Safe Deserialization
```python
from core.events import EventFactory, default_schema_registry

factory = EventFactory(default_schema_registry)
event = factory.deserialize(nats_message)  # Returns typed event object
```

**Responsibilities**: Maps event types to Python classes, handles decompression and JSON parsing.

### 3. EventPublisherService - Reliable Publishing
```python
from core.events import get_event_publisher

publisher = get_event_publisher(settings)
await publisher.publish("subject.name", event)  # With retries & compression
```

**Responsibilities**: Event serialization, compression, retry logic with exponential backoff.

### 4. SubscriberManager - Declarative Event Handlers
```python
from core.events import subscriber, create_subscriber_manager

@subscriber.on_event("market.tick.NSE.*", durable_name="my-consumer")
async def handle_market_ticks(event: MarketDataEvent):
    print(f"Received tick: {event.last_price}")

# At startup
manager = create_subscriber_manager(settings)
await manager.start()  # Discovers and subscribes all @subscriber decorated functions
```

**Responsibilities**: Decorator-based subscription discovery, message routing, error handling.

### 5. StreamManager - Stream Lifecycle
```python
from core.events import create_stream_manager

stream_manager = create_stream_manager(settings, event_bus)
await stream_manager.ensure_streams()  # Creates MARKET_DATA, TRADING, SYSTEM streams
```

**Responsibilities**: NATS JetStream stream creation and configuration.

## Quick Start

### 1. Application Startup
```python
import asyncio
from core.events import (
    get_event_bus_core, get_event_publisher, 
    create_subscriber_manager, create_stream_manager
)
from core.config.settings import Settings

async def startup():
    settings = Settings()
    
    # 1. Connect to NATS
    event_bus = get_event_bus_core(settings)
    await event_bus.connect()
    
    # 2. Create streams
    stream_manager = create_stream_manager(settings, event_bus)
    await stream_manager.ensure_streams()
    
    # 3. Start subscribers (discovers @subscriber decorated functions)
    subscriber_manager = create_subscriber_manager(settings, event_bus)
    await subscriber_manager.start()
    
    return event_bus, subscriber_manager
```

### 2. Define Event Handlers
```python
from core.events import subscriber
from core.events.event_types import SystemEvent, MarketDataEvent

@subscriber.on_event("system.*")
async def handle_system_events(event: SystemEvent):
    print(f"System event: {event.message}")

@subscriber.on_event("market.tick.*", durable_name="strategy-ticks")
async def handle_market_data(event: MarketDataEvent):
    print(f"Price update: {event.instrument_token} @ {event.last_price}")
```

### 3. Publish Events
```python
from core.events import get_event_publisher
from core.events.event_types import SystemEvent, EventType
from datetime import datetime, timezone

publisher = get_event_publisher()

event = SystemEvent(
    event_id="sys-001",
    event_type=EventType.SYSTEM_STARTED,
    timestamp=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    source="my_component",
    component="trading_engine",
    severity="INFO",
    message="Trading engine started"
)

await publisher.publish("system.trading.started", event)
```

### 4. Application Shutdown
```python
async def shutdown(subscriber_manager, event_bus):
    await subscriber_manager.stop()  # Unsubscribe all handlers
    await event_bus.disconnect()     # Close NATS connection
```

## Event Types

All events inherit from `BaseEvent` and are strongly typed:

- **SystemEvent**: System lifecycle and health events
- **MarketDataEvent**: Market data updates (ticks, depth)
- **TradingEvent**: Trading signals and order events
- **RiskEvent**: Risk management alerts

## Subject Patterns

Events follow hierarchical naming:

```
market.tick.{exchange}.{instrument_token}    # Market data
trading.signal.{strategy}.{instrument}       # Trading signals
trading.order.{action}.{order_id}            # Order events
system.{component}.{status}                  # System events
risk.{type}.{strategy}                       # Risk alerts
```

## Global Instance Pattern Implementation

The event system uses a **Global Instance Pattern** to route decorator-based handlers to component instances:

```python
# Module-level global instance variable
_storage_manager_instance: Optional['MarketDataStorageManager'] = None

# Module-level decorator handlers
@subscriber.on_event("market.tick.*", durable_name="storage-ticks")
async def handle_market_tick_storage(event: MarketDataEvent) -> None:
    """Route market tick events to storage manager instance."""
    global _storage_manager_instance
    if _storage_manager_instance:
        await _storage_manager_instance._handle_market_tick_event(event)

# Component registers itself during startup
class MarketDataStorageManager:
    async def start(self) -> bool:
        global _storage_manager_instance
        _storage_manager_instance = self  # Register for event routing
        # ... rest of startup
    
    async def stop(self) -> None:
        global _storage_manager_instance
        _storage_manager_instance = None  # Unregister
        # ... rest of shutdown
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Decorator handlers are discovered at import time
- ✅ Events are routed to active component instances
- ✅ Clean separation between event registration and component lifecycle
- ✅ Automatic cleanup when components shut down

## Configuration

Configure via settings:

```python
# Publishing
settings.event_system.publishing.max_retries = 3
settings.event_system.publishing.compression_enabled = True

# Streams
settings.event_system.stream_management.market_data_retention_hours = 24
settings.event_system.stream_management.trading_retention_hours = 168

# Dead Letter Queue
settings.event_system.dead_letter_queue.enabled = True
```

## Error Handling

The system handles errors gracefully:

- **Parsing Failures**: Custom `EventParsingError` with context
- **Publishing Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff, then `EventPublishError`
- **Subscription Failures**: Messages terminated to prevent redelivery loops

## Clean Architecture - No Legacy Dependencies

This is a **complete rewrite** of the event system with **no legacy compatibility**:

```python
# ✅ New Event System (Only supported approach)
from core.events import get_event_bus_core, get_event_publisher, subscriber

# ❌ Legacy EventBus - COMPLETELY REMOVED
# No legacy imports or compatibility layers exist
```

**Clean Implementation:**
- ✅ Pure refactor plan implementation
- ✅ No legacy code or compatibility layers  
- ✅ Clean, modern architecture only
- ✅ Immediate adoption of new patterns

## Design Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Type Safety**: Schema-driven deserialization prevents runtime errors  
3. **Declarative**: Clean `@subscriber.on_event` decorator pattern
4. **Reliable**: Automatic retries, compression, error handling
5. **Maintainable**: Clear component boundaries and minimal coupling
6. **Global Instance Pattern**: Decorator handlers route to component instances automatically

- ✅ Performance characteristics maintained

**Deployment Safety:** The current state is production-ready with all core component subscriptions operational. The system provides comprehensive event-driven communication across all AlphaPT components.

## Outstanding Issues and Limitations

### ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Module Import Dependencies**: The Global Instance Pattern requires modules with `@subscriber` decorators to be imported for handlers to be discovered. The application handles this automatically during initialization.

2. **Consumer Configuration Fallback**: Some NATS JetStream consumer configurations may fail with advanced settings and fall back to minimal configurations. This is handled gracefully with retry logic.

3. **Stream Timing Dependencies**: Stream creation and subscription timing can occasionally cause race conditions. The system includes stream readiness detection and retry mechanisms.

### 🔄 Remaining Work

1. **API Layer WebSocket Subscriptions**: WebSocket real-time event subscriptions are not yet migrated to the new system (marked as ⏳ in integration status).

2. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: While error handling is comprehensive, additional circuit breaker patterns could be implemented for external service failures.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Event processing metrics and throughput monitoring could be enhanced with more detailed performance analytics.

### 🎯 Future Enhancements

1. **Event Replay Capabilities**: Implement event replay functionality for debugging and recovery scenarios.

2. **Dead Letter Queue Processing**: Implement automated dead letter queue processing and alerting.

3. **Dynamic Subscription Management**: Allow runtime addition/removal of event subscriptions without application restart.

4. **Event Aggregation Patterns**: Implement event aggregation patterns for high-frequency market data processing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Subscribers Not Receiving Events**

**Symptoms**: Events are published but handlers are not triggered.

**Possible Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Global instance not set**: Component didn't register itself during startup
   ```python
   # Check if global instance is set in component start() method
   global _component_instance
   _component_instance = self
   ```

2. **Module not imported**: The module with `@subscriber` decorators wasn't imported
   ```python
   # Ensure modules are imported during application startup
   import storage.storage_manager  # This registers the decorators
   ```

3. **Subscriber manager not started**: The application didn't start the subscriber manager
   ```python
   # Check application.py has subscriber manager initialization
   subscriber_manager = create_subscriber_manager(settings, event_bus_core)
   await subscriber_manager.start()
   ```

#### **Consumer Configuration Errors**

**Symptoms**: `JetStreamContext.subscribe() got an unexpected keyword argument 'consumer'`

**Solution**: The system automatically falls back to minimal consumer configuration.

#### **Stream Timing Errors**

**Symptoms**: `nats: no response from stream`

**Solution**: The system includes stream readiness detection with automatic retry.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check Subscriber Registration**:
   ```python
   from core.events.subscriber_manager import subscriber
   print(f"Registered handlers: {len(subscriber.handlers)}")
   for pattern, info in subscriber.handlers.items():
       print(f"  {pattern}: {info['callback'].__name__}")
   ```

2. **Verify Component Global Instances**:
   ```python
   # Check if components are registered
   from storage.storage_manager import _storage_manager_instance
   print(f"Storage manager instance: {_storage_manager_instance}")
   ```

3. **Monitor Event Publishing**:
   ```python
   # Use event publisher with logging
   publisher = get_event_publisher(settings)
   await publisher.publish("test.subject", event)
   # Check logs for publish success/failure
   ```

## Critical Lessons Learned - Race Condition Prevention

### 🚨 Race Condition Mitigation Patterns

The following critical lessons were learned from resolving production race conditions in the event system:

#### **1. Stream Readiness Signaling Pattern**

**Problem**: Components published events before NATS JetStream streams were fully ready, causing `nats: no response from stream` errors.

**Solution**: Implement explicit readiness signaling:

```python
# EventBusCore - Add readiness state management
class EventBusCore:
    def __init__(self, settings: Settings):
        self._streams_ready_event = asyncio.Event()  # NEW: Readiness signal
    
    @property
    def is_fully_ready(self) -> bool:
        """Only True when connected AND streams are ready"""
        return self._is_connected and self._streams_ready_event.is_set()
    
    def signal_streams_ready(self) -> None:
        """Called by StreamManager after streams are created"""
        self._streams_ready_event.set()
    
    async def wait_for_ready(self, timeout: float = 30.0) -> None:
        """Block until fully ready"""
        await asyncio.wait_for(self._streams_ready_event.wait(), timeout=timeout)
```

**Implementation Pattern**:
- ✅ **Connection State**: Track basic NATS connection (`is_connected`)
- ✅ **Readiness State**: Track stream readiness (`is_fully_ready`)  
- ✅ **Synchronization**: Use `asyncio.Event` for cross-component coordination
- ✅ **Signaling**: StreamManager signals readiness after stream creation

#### **2. Application Startup Sequencing**

**Problem**: Services started publishing events immediately after component creation, racing with stream setup.

**Solution**: Separate initialization from startup with explicit readiness wait:

```python
# Application startup sequence
async def initialize(self) -> bool:
    # Phase 1: Create instances (no event publishing)
    await self._init_event_bus()      # Creates EventBusCore + streams
    await self._init_strategy_manager()  # Creates instance only
    
async def start(self) -> bool:
    # Phase 2: Wait for readiness, then start services
    await self.app_state["event_bus"].wait_for_ready(timeout=60.0)
    await self.app_state["strategy_manager"].start()  # Now safe to publish
```

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ **Separation**: Initialize components without starting them
- ✅ **Sequencing**: Wait for infrastructure readiness before service startup
- ✅ **Explicit Coordination**: Use `wait_for_ready()` as synchronization point

#### **3. Publisher Readiness Validation**

**Problem**: EventPublisherService attempted publishing before streams were confirmed ready.

**Solution**: Check full readiness in publish method:

```python
async def publish(self, subject: str, event: BaseEvent) -> None:
    # OLD: Only checked connection
    if not self.bus.is_connected:
        raise EventPublishError("Not connected")
    
    # NEW: Check full readiness (connection + streams)
    if not self.bus.is_fully_ready:
        raise EventPublishError("Event bus is not fully ready")
```

#### **4. Graceful Shutdown Sequencing**

**Problem**: Components published final events while NATS connection was already closing, causing errors.

**Solution**: Stop event producers before closing infrastructure:

```python
async def cleanup(self):
    # 1. Stop components that produce events FIRST
    stoppable_services = [
        self.app_state.get("strategy_manager"),
        self.app_state.get("risk_manager"),
        # ... other event producers
    ]
    
    # 2. Execute cleanup tasks concurrently with exception handling
    cleanup_tasks = []
    for service in stoppable_services:
        if service and hasattr(service, 'stop'):
            cleanup_tasks.append(service.stop())
    
    if cleanup_tasks:
        results = await asyncio.gather(*cleanup_tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    # 3. THEN stop event infrastructure
    if self.app_state.get("event_bus"):
        await self.app_state["event_bus"].disconnect()
```

**Critical Pattern**: Event producers → Event infrastructure → Database connections

### 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

#### **For Component Developers**

1. **Never publish events in `__init__()` or `initialize()`**:
   ```python
   # ❌ DON'T: Publish in initialization
   async def initialize(self):
       await self.event_publisher.publish("started", event)
   
   # ✅ DO: Publish only in start() method  
   async def start(self):
       # This is called after event bus is fully ready
       await self.event_publisher.publish("started", event)
   ```

2. **Always check publisher readiness**:
   ```python
   # ✅ Publisher automatically checks is_fully_ready
   await self.event_publisher.publish(subject, event)
   ```

3. **Handle shutdown gracefully**:
   ```python
   async def stop(self):
       # Publish final events while connection still available
       await self.event_publisher.publish("stopping", event, ignore_failures=True)
       # Then cleanup resources
   ```

#### **For Application Developers**

1. **Implement startup sequencing**:
   ```python
   async def startup():
       # Phase 1: Infrastructure
       await init_database()
       await init_event_bus()
       
       # Phase 2: Wait for readiness
       await event_bus.wait_for_ready()
       
       # Phase 3: Start services
       await start_services()
   ```

2. **Implement cleanup sequencing**:
   ```python
   async def cleanup():
       await stop_event_producers()  # First
       await stop_event_infrastructure()  # Then
       await close_database()  # Last
   ```

### 🎯 Race Condition Prevention Checklist

When implementing new components:

- [ ] **Separate `initialize()` and `start()` methods**
- [ ] **Use `wait_for_ready()` before publishing events** 
- [ ] **Check `is_fully_ready` in publishers**
- [ ] **Signal readiness after setup completion**
- [ ] **Stop event producers before infrastructure**
- [ ] **Use `ignore_failures=True` for shutdown events**
- [ ] **Handle exceptions in concurrent cleanup tasks**

### 📊 Monitoring Race Conditions

Add these logs to detect race condition issues:

```python
# In application startup
logger.info("Waiting for event bus to become fully ready...")
await event_bus.wait_for_ready(timeout=60.0)
logger.info("✅ Event bus is fully ready - starting services")

# In publishers  
if not self.bus.is_fully_ready:
    logger.error("Attempted to publish before event bus fully ready")
    
# In cleanup
logger.info("🧹 Starting graceful shutdown - stopping event producers first")
```

These patterns prevent the "perfect storm" of race conditions that can cause event system failures during startup and shutdown.
