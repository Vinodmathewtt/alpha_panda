# 🐼 Alpha Panda - Algorithmic Trading System

A modern algorithmic trading system built on the Unified Log architecture using Redpanda for event streaming. Features comprehensive testing, multi-broker architecture, and production-ready reliability patterns.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Unified Log Architecture with Redpanda**

- **Single Source of Truth**: All dynamic data flows through Redpanda event streams
- **Multi-Broker Architecture**: Complete isolation between paper and zerodha trading with unified service deployment
- **Configuration Store**: Static configuration in PostgreSQL
- **Read Path**: FastAPI serves from Redis cache
- **Pure Strategy Logic**: Strategies are completely decoupled from infrastructure

**End-to-End Pipeline Flow:**

```
Market Feed Service (Single Instance)
       ↓ (market.ticks topic - shared across all brokers)
Strategy Runner Service (Multi-Broker)
       ↓ (broker.signals.raw topics - paper.signals.raw, zerodha.signals.raw)
Risk Manager Service (Multi-Broker)
       ↓ (broker.signals.validated topics - paper.signals.validated, zerodha.signals.validated)
Trading Engine Service (Multi-Broker)
       ↓ (broker.orders.filled topics - paper.orders.filled, zerodha.orders.filled)
Portfolio Manager Service (Multi-Broker)
       ↓ (Redis cache with broker prefixes - paper:portfolio:, zerodha:portfolio:)
API Service (Read Path - Unified)
```

**Key Architecture Patterns:**

- **Single Service Deployments**: Each service instance handles all active brokers
- **Topic-Aware Handlers**: Extract broker context from topic names for routing
- **Unified Consumer Groups**: One consumer group per service processes all broker topics
- **Cache Key Isolation**: Redis keys prefixed by broker for complete data separation
- **StreamServiceBuilder Pattern**: Composition-based service orchestration with fluent API
- **Protocol-Based Contracts**: Type-safe interfaces for service dependencies
- **Performance Optimizations**: O(1) instrument-to-strategy mappings for efficient routing

## 🏢 Multi-Broker Architecture

**CRITICAL**: Alpha Panda uses a **hybrid namespace approach** where a single deployment manages multiple brokers (paper/zerodha) while maintaining complete data isolation:

- **Topic-Level Isolation**: All topics prefixed by broker (`paper.*` vs `zerodha.*`) for hard data segregation
- **Single Service Deployment**: One service instance handles all active brokers simultaneously
- **Unified Consumer Groups**: Single consumer group per service consumes from all broker-specific topics
- **Topic-Aware Handlers**: Services extract broker context from topic names for routing decisions
- **Cache Key Separation**: Redis keys prefixed (`paper:*` vs `zerodha:*`) for state isolation

**Configuration:**

```bash
# Multi-broker deployment (default)
ACTIVE_BROKERS=paper,zerodha python cli.py run

# Single broker deployment
ACTIVE_BROKERS=paper python cli.py run
```

See [Multi-Broker Architecture](docs/architecture/MULTI_BROKER_ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed implementation patterns.

### 🏗️ Advanced Architecture Patterns

Alpha Panda implements several advanced architectural patterns for maintainable, scalable trading systems:

#### StreamServiceBuilder Pattern

**Composition-Based Service Orchestration**

All services use the StreamServiceBuilder for consistent setup with fluent API:

```python
# Example from MarketFeedService
self.orchestrator = (StreamServiceBuilder("market_feed", config, settings)
    .with_redis(redis_client)        # Optional Redis integration
    .with_error_handling()           # Automatic DLQ and retry logic
    .with_metrics()                  # Performance monitoring
    .add_producer()                  # Kafka producer with idempotence
    .add_consumer_handler(           # Topic-aware consumer
        topics=[TopicNames.MARKET_TICKS],
        group_id="alpha-panda.market-feed",
        handler_func=self._handle_message
    )
    .build()
)
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Consistent Configuration**: All services use same patterns
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Built-in DLQ and retry mechanisms
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Automatic metrics collection
- ✅ **Testability**: Easy to mock components for testing

#### Topic-Aware Handler Pattern

**Broker Context Extraction from Topic Names**

All message handlers accept `(message, topic)` parameters for broker-aware processing:

```python
# Example from TradingEngineService
async def _handle_validated_signal(self, message: Dict[str, Any], topic: str) -> None:
    # Extract broker from topic name for routing decisions
    broker = topic.split('.')[0]  # "paper.signals.validated" -> "paper"

    # Route to appropriate trader based on broker context
    trader = self.trader_factory.get_trader(broker)
    await trader.execute_order(signal)
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Single Service Instance**: One deployment handles all brokers
- ✅ **Dynamic Routing**: Runtime broker determination
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Complete segregation maintained

#### Performance Optimization Patterns

**Efficient Data Structures for High-Frequency Trading**

Strategy runner uses reverse mappings for O(1) instrument lookups:

```python
# Efficient instrument-to-strategy mapping
class StrategyRunnerService:
    def __init__(self):
        # O(1) lookup instead of O(n) iteration
        self.instrument_to_strategies: Dict[int, List[str]] = defaultdict(list)

    async def _handle_market_tick(self, message: Dict[str, Any], topic: str):
        instrument_token = message['data']['instrument_token']
        # Instant lookup of interested strategies
        interested_strategies = self.instrument_to_strategies.get(instrument_token, [])
```

**Performance Targets Met:**

- ✅ **>100 msg/sec throughput** with optimized lookups
- ✅ **<50ms average latency** with efficient routing
- ✅ **Memory stability** with bounded data structures

#### Protocol-Based Service Contracts

**Type-Safe Interface Design**

Services implement protocols for dependency injection and testing:

```python
# Future enhancement: Service protocols
from typing import Protocol

class MarketFeedProtocol(Protocol):
    async def start(self) -> None: ...
    async def stop(self) -> None: ...
    def get_connection_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...

class TradingEngineProtocol(Protocol):
    async def execute_signal(self, signal: Dict[str, Any], broker: str) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    def get_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Type Safety**: Compile-time interface validation
- ✅ **Testability**: Easy mocking with protocol compliance
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear contracts between components

#### Composition-First Design Philosophy

**Modern Python Architecture Principles**

Alpha Panda follows composition-over-inheritance patterns throughout:

```python
# PREFERRED: Composition + Protocol pattern (future strategy framework)
class StrategyProcessor(Protocol):
    def process_market_data(self, data: MarketData) -> List[TradingSignal]: ...

class StrategyExecutor:
    def __init__(self, processor: StrategyProcessor, config: StrategyConfig):
        self._processor = processor  # Composition over inheritance
        self._config = config

    async def execute(self, market_data: MarketData) -> List[TradingSignal]:
        return self._processor.process_market_data(market_data)

# Strategy implementations as simple classes
class MomentumProcessor:
    def process_market_data(self, data: MarketData) -> List[TradingSignal]:
        # Pure strategy logic without base class dependencies
        pass
```

**Current vs Future Strategy Design:**

| Current (BaseStrategy)        | Future (Composition)      | Benefits                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Inheritance-based             | Protocol + Composition    | ✅ Better testability   |
| Tight coupling                | Loose coupling            | ✅ Easier mocking       |
| Hard to extend                | Easy to extend            | ✅ Flexible composition |
| Base class changes affect all | Interface-based stability | ✅ Reduced coupling     |

**Migration Strategy:**

- ✅ Keep existing `BaseStrategy` for backward compatibility
- 🔄 Implement new composition framework alongside
- 🔄 Gradually migrate strategies to new pattern
- 🔄 Mark `BaseStrategy` as deprecated once migration complete

## 🎯 Design Principles

### Core Architecture Principles

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: All dynamic data through event streams
- **Broker Isolation**: Complete segregation between paper and zerodha
- **Schemas First**: Event contracts defined before implementation
- **No Wildcards**: Explicit topic subscriptions only
- **Mandatory Keys**: Every message has partition key for ordering
- **Producer Safety**: Idempotent producers with acks=all
- **Testing Excellence**: Production-ready testing at all levels

### Modern Development Principles (2025)

- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer dependency injection and Protocol contracts
- **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: Observable failures with clear error messages
- **Performance-First**: O(1) lookups and efficient data structures
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with Protocol-based interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Small, focused services with clear boundaries
- **Testability**: Protocol-based mocking and dependency injection

### Service Design Patterns

- **StreamServiceBuilder**: Consistent service orchestration with fluent API
- **Topic-Aware Handlers**: Dynamic broker routing from topic context
- **Protocol Contracts**: Type-safe interfaces for service dependencies
- **Reverse Mappings**: Performance optimizations for high-frequency operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

## 🚀 Virtual Environment & Dependencies (CRITICAL)

**🚨 MANDATORY**: Always activate the virtual environment and use constraints for dependency management:

```bash
# 1. Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # Linux/Mac
# OR: venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# 2. Install dependencies with version constraints (Python 3.13 compatible)
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt

# 3. For development, use the make command that includes constraints
make dev  # Automatically uses constraints for installation
```

**Why Constraints Are Critical:**

- ✅ **Python 3.13 Compatibility** - Optimized dependency versions
- ✅ **Version Stability** - Prevents breaking changes with upper bounds
- ✅ **CI/CD Reliability** - Ensures reproducible builds across environments
- ✅ **Dependency Safety** - Prevents future compatibility issues

**Key Constraint Examples:**

```bash
# constraints.txt
dependency-injector>=4.43,<5    # Python 3.13 optimized
fastapi>=0.104.0,<0.200.0        # Stable version range
pydantic>=2.5.0,<3.0.0           # Prevents breaking changes
```

This approach prevents conflicts with system packages, ensures consistent dependency management, and maintains Python 3.13 compatibility.
