# Monitoring and Infrastructure Improvements

This document outlines longer-term improvements identified from the issues analysis in `docs/ISSUES_TO_BE_FIXED.md`. These improvements require systematic implementation over time to enhance system reliability and observability.

## 1. Pipeline Monitoring Enhancements

### Issue: Metrics Key Namespace Mismatch
**Current Problem**: Pipeline monitor reads keys with `alpha_panda:metrics:` prefix while writers use `pipeline:` namespace, causing false "no signals" alerts.

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. **Standardize Key Namespaces**: Align all monitoring components to use consistent Redis key patterns
2. **Centralized Metrics Configuration**: Create single configuration point for all metric key patterns
3. **Runtime Key Validation**: Add startup checks to verify metric key alignment

### Issue: Overly Strict Monitoring Thresholds
**Current Problem**: Market data latency threshold of 1.0s causes frequent false positives with observed ~3.5s latencies.

**Recommended Improvements**:
1. **Environment-Specific Thresholds**: Configure different thresholds for dev/test/prod environments  
2. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Implement dynamic thresholds based on historical performance
3. **Threshold Documentation**: Document expected performance characteristics per service

## 2. Configuration Management Improvements

### Issue: Broker Configuration Drift
**Current Problem**: Settings may include brokers without corresponding enabled strategies, causing monitoring noise.

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. **Configuration Validation**: Add startup validation ensuring active brokers have corresponding strategies
2. **Configuration Consistency Checks**: Implement automated checks for broker/strategy alignment
3. **Dynamic Configuration Updates**: Support runtime configuration changes without service restart

## 3. Event Schema Validation Improvements

### Issue: Missing Schema Validation at Runtime
**Current Problem**: Pydantic validation errors occur at runtime instead of being caught earlier.

**Recommended Enhancements**:
1. **Build-Time Schema Validation**: Add tests that validate all event model creation patterns
2. **Schema Compatibility Checks**: Implement automated checks for schema field completeness  
3. **Schema Evolution Strategy**: Define versioned schema evolution patterns for backward compatibility

## 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Observability

### Issue: Limited Error Context and Tracing
**Current Problem**: Errors lack sufficient context for debugging multi-service interactions.

**Recommended Improvements**:
1. **Distributed Tracing**: Implement OpenTelemetry for cross-service request tracing
2. **Structured Error Context**: Enhance error logging with correlation IDs and request context
3. **Error Classification**: Implement systematic error classification (transient, permanent, critical)
4. **Alerting Strategy**: Define alert rules based on error patterns and business impact

## 5. Data Quality and Consistency Improvements

### Issue: Inconsistent PnL Snapshot Schema
**Current Problem**: Portfolio service emits raw dictionary data without schema validation.

**Recommended Solutions**:
1. **Schema-First Event Design**: Always validate events against Pydantic models before emission
2. **Event Contract Testing**: Implement contract tests between services for event compatibility
3. **Data Quality Metrics**: Add monitoring for schema validation failures and data quality issues

## 6. Performance and Scalability Improvements

### Issue: Inefficient Signal Processing
**Current Problem**: Strategy runner may iterate through all strategies for each tick.

**Recommended Optimizations**:
1. **Reverse Index Optimization**: Maintain instrument-to-strategy mappings for O(1) lookups
2. **Batch Processing**: Implement batched tick processing for better throughput
3. **Async Processing Patterns**: Optimize async processing patterns for better resource utilization

## Implementation Prioritization

**HIGH PRIORITY** (Implement in next 2 sprints):
- Pipeline monitoring key namespace alignment
- Configuration validation at startup
- Build-time schema validation tests

**MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Implement in next 6 months):
- Distributed tracing implementation
- Adaptive monitoring thresholds
- Performance optimizations

**LOW PRIORITY** (Implement as time permits):
- Advanced error classification
- Dynamic configuration management
- Comprehensive contract testing

## Integration with Development Workflow

These improvements should be integrated into the development workflow through:

1. **Gradual Implementation**: Address one improvement area per development cycle
2. **Testing Integration**: Each improvement must include comprehensive tests
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update relevant documentation as improvements are implemented
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Ensure improvements are monitored and measured for effectiveness

## Success Metrics

Track improvement effectiveness through:
- Reduction in false positive monitoring alerts
- Decreased time to diagnose production issues  
- Improved system reliability metrics
- Enhanced developer productivity metrics
